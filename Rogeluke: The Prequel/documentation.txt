	SECTION B: GAMEPLAY ASPECTS

RLIV:I is a text-based adventure game with aspects from roguelikes, such as permadeath, character progression, a full inventory system, a magic system, an alchemy system,
random world generation, and combat based on RNG and dice rolls.

RLIV:I is based on the concepts and lore of Rogeluke, Rogeluke II: Reckoning, Rogeluke III: Abrogation, and similar roguelikes such as Dwarf Fortress, Rogue, ADOM,
and several D&D 5e campaigns. Do note that because of the text-based nature of RLIV:I, some planned features will be extremely difficult to implement and perhaps
impossible without having to resort to ASCII graphics in a terminal, which defeats the core aesthetic and idea of the game. 

In RLIV:I, you play as a dungeon-dwelling adventurer that goes on quests for loot and prestige. Your character is based on a few main stats:

- Strength (STR), which determines your total carrying capacity, melee weapon proficiency, and unarmed offense,
- Dexterity (DEX), which determines your sneaking ability, climbing skill, ranged weapon proficiency and dodge skill,
- Constitution (CON), which determines your poison resistance, unarmed defense, and HP pool,
- Intellect (INT), which determines your MP pool, magic resistance, psychic resistance, magic attack, identification skill, alchemy skill, and lore skill,
- Luck (LCK), which determines the quality of loot, enemy challenge rating, and amplifies the success chance on skill and attack rolls.

There are also a couple minor stats:

- Medicine (MDC), which determines the success chance at self-healing and target healing,
- Lockpicking (LPK), which determines the success chance at picking locks on doors and chests,
- Alchemy (ALC), which determines potion potency and success chance at potion discovery,
- STR Weapon Fighting (SRF), which determines the amount of damage you deal using a STR-stat weapon,
- DEX Weapon Fighting (DXF), which determines the amount of damage you deal using a DEX-stat weapon.

For the time being, the game will be set in a pre-generated cave system with a victory condition (leaving the cave). This will be removed from the final game, and instead will be replaced
by a completely procedurally generated world with no obvious victory conditions.
